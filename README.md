# WeatherApp

## Overview
WeatherApp is a simple, intuitive, and responsive web application that provides real-time weather updates. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and fetches data from a weather API.

## Features
- **Real-time weather updates**: Get the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city in the world.
- **Search functionality**: Easily search for cities to get their current weather conditions.
## How It Works
The application uses the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to a weather API. When a user searches for a city, an HTTP GET request is made to the API, which returns the current weather data for that city. This data is then displayed on the webpage.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mukesh0902/WeatherApp.git`
2. Open `WeatherApp.html` in your browser to run the application.

## Usage
Enter the name of the city in the search box and click on Search icon. The weather details of the city will be displayed on the screen.
